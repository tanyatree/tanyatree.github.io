# 🌱 Tanya Tree — Learning in Public

Hi, I’m **Tanya** — a Python 🐍 and Django 🌐 engineer who loves learning new things and writing about them.  
This space is my **developer notebook**: part journal, part portfolio, and part playground for ideas.

I write about things I learn, from small “aha!” moments to deep dives into code design, optimization, and creativity.

### 🔹 *What I Learned About Big O (and why I wish I knew this sooner)*

> Today I finally understood what `O(n)` and `O(1)` mean in code.  
> I realized that all those times I looped through CSVs and queried the DB each time,  
> I was actually writing something closer to `O(n * query_time)` 😅  
>
> After learning about dictionary lookups and preloading data,  
> I optimized a script that used to take minutes — now it finishes in less than a second ⚡  
>
> This made me realize how important it is to understand not just *how* code works,  
> but *how it scales*.

## 🐾 About Me

I’ve been working with Django for years — building CRMs, dashboards, APIs, and automations —  
and I still find joy in those moments when something *clicks*.  
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me walking, cooking, or hanging out with my cat 🐱 **Mini**.
