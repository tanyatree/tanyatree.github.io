# 🌱 Tanya Tree — Learning in Public

Hi, I’m **Tanya** — a Python 🐍 and Django 🌐 engineer who loves learning new things and writing about them.
This space is my **developer notebook**: part journal, part portfolio, and part playground for ideas.

## 🌟 Featured Entry

### 🔹 *What I Learned About Big O (and why I wish I knew this sooner)*

> Understanding what `O(n)` and `O(1)` mean in code can be a game changer.
> Many times when looping through CSVs or querying the DB repeatedly,
> the complexity is closer to `O(n * query_time)` 😅
>
> Learning about dictionary lookups and preloading data can optimize scripts that once took minutes — making them finish in less than a second ⚡
>
> This highlights how important it is to understand not just *how* code works,
> but *how it scales*.

## 🐾 About Me

I’ve been working with Django for years — building CRMs, dashboards, APIs, and automations —
and I still find joy in those moments when something *clicks*.
When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me walking, cooking, or hanging out with my cat 🐱 **Mini**.
